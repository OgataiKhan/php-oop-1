# PHP OOP 1

This project is intended to practice the use of php classes and their instances.

The featured class, "Movie", includes a constructor used to set most of its properties, a method used to set the release year, and a method used to display its properties as a li item.

The "genre" property accepts an array of genres and the release year displays as "Upcoming" if greater than 2024.
