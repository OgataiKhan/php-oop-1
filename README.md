# PHP OOP 1

This project is intended to practice the use of php classes and their instances.

The featured class, "Movie", includes a constructor used to set most of its properties, a method used to set the release year, and a method used to display its properties as a li item.  
The constructor takes as its arguments the movie title (string), the release year (int), the director (string), the genres (array), and the original language (string).

The release year displays as "Upcoming" if greater than 2024.
